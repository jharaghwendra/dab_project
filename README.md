# Databricks Lakehouse Projects with DAB (Databricks Asset Bundle)

This repository contains three Databricks deliverables:

- a Citibike Databricks Asset Bundle project with its own catalog and schema
- an iGaming Databricks Asset Bundle project presented under the `gaming_lakehouse` project name
- an iGaming dbt Gold-layer project in `dbt_gold/`

Together they show how I build Databricks projects across ingestion, transformation, orchestration, testing, and Gold-layer modeling.

---

## Project Overview

- Citibike DAB: separate catalog/schema, Bronze-Silver-Gold processing, local and Databricks Connect tests
- iGaming DAB: delivered under the `gaming_lakehouse` name, Bronze-Silver processing with jobs and pipelines in `resources/jobs/` and `resources/pipelines/`
- iGaming dbt Gold layer: located in `dbt_gold/` with incremental models, tests, snapshots, and CI/CD workflows to support the iGaming BI platform

## dbt Work

The dbt work for the iGaming project lives in [dbt_gold](dbt_gold) and follows a standard analytics-engineering structure.

### Location

```text
dbt_gold/
├── dbt_project.yml
├── profiles.yml
├── models/
│   ├── facts/
│   ├── dimensions/
│   ├── marts/
│   └── sources/
├── macros/
├── snapshots/
├── tests/
└── target/
```

### dbt Highlights

- Incremental fact models with merge strategy
- Late-arriving data handling with lookback logic
- Surrogate key generation using `dbt_utils`
- Snapshot-based SCD2 history tracking
- Generic tests, singular tests, custom generic tests, source tests, and unit tests
- Source freshness and state-based workflows
- Documentation-ready model structure for analytics consumers

These pieces show how I handle late-arriving data, preserve history, validate models at multiple layers, and keep downstream reporting stable.

### Strong dbt example: `fact_payments`

The [fact_payments.sql](dbt_gold/models/facts/fact_payments.sql) model is a strong example of production-style dbt design:

- incremental `merge` strategy
- 2-day lookback for late-arriving status updates
- surrogate key generation via `dbt_utils`
- business-rule logic for declined deposit retries and first-deposit flags
- timezone-aware date handling
- BI-friendly denormalized output for downstream reporting tools

### Testing and quality checks

- Generic tests in YAML for column integrity
- Singular tests in `tests/` for business rules
- Custom generic tests in `macros/` for reusable validations
- Unit tests in model YAML for isolated SQL logic
- Source tests and source freshness checks for upstream reliability

### Dev and delivery workflow

- Local validation through dbt test commands
- CI/CD automation via GitHub workflows
- Separate dev, test, and prod targets in the dbt profile

## iGaming DAB Project

The iGaming DAB implementation is presented here under the `gaming_lakehouse` project name:

### Folder Structure

```text
dab_project/
└── ...
```

### End-to-End Execution Flow

The pipeline is organized as Bronze, Silver, and Gold processing with Databricks Workflows and DLT.
The DAB jobs and resources for that flow live under `resources/jobs/` and `resources/pipelines/`.

### Gold Layer

- Gold models are built with dbt and Databricks SQL Warehouse, consuming the prepared Silver layer as input.

---

## CI/CD Workflow

The GitHub Actions workflows live in [.github/workflows](.github/workflows).

### CI workflow: [.github/workflows/ci-workflow.yml](.github/workflows/ci-workflow.yml)

- Runs on feature branches and pull requests into `main`
- Sets up Python, installs dependencies, runs pytest, and publishes coverage
- Runs `dbt parse` so SQL and model references are checked before deployment

### CD workflow: [.github/workflows/cd-workflow.yml](.github/workflows/cd-workflow.yml)

- Runs when code lands on `main`
- Deploys the bundle to the test environment first
- Then deploys to prod after the test deploy succeeds and the prod environment gate allows it
- Uses Databricks CLI and bundle deploy commands for the release step

### What this shows

- Pull requests are validated before merge
- Test deployment is automated from the main branch
- Prod deployment is separated from test and can be protected by environment approval
- The same bundle is promoted through the release flow instead of maintaining separate deploy logic per environment

## Getting Started

Use two Python environments when you work on the Citibike project:

- `.venv_pyspark` for local unit tests and source development
- `.venv_dbc` for Databricks Connect tests and notebook-style work

Databricks authentication comes from `~/.databrickscfg`, and the Databricks CLI is used for bundle deploy and run commands.

VS Code is most useful here when the Databricks extension is installed and the right interpreter is selected for the file you are editing.

For exact install and run commands, use the test and deploy sections above and below rather than duplicating them here.
